# Node Version Fix

Having problems with your current version of Node? Getting some funky errors? Well look no further because this guide will get you set up with a different version of Node.

If you are using a Windows machine, download [git-bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) before proceeding.

## Step 1
If you have already installed the latest version of Node at [nodejs.org](https://www.nodejs.org), then go ahead and skip to step two. If not, download the latest stable release of Node.

## Step 2
Crack open your terminal or git-bash and navigate to your home/root directory. Just like NPM, Node also has a version manager, meet NPM's cousin, NVM. Type/copy & paste this into your terminal:
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.4/install.sh | bash
```

This will install NVM on your machine.

Once the installation of NVM is complete, type/copy & paste both of these lines into your terminal:
```
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
```
This will allow you to use NVM to easily install and switch between versions of Node!

Just to ensure NVM properly installed, type this into your terminal ```command -v nvm```.

As long as you see ```nvm``` listed below your command, you are in good shape.

## Step 3
Now this is where the magic happens! Type out ```nvm install 5.3``` to install version 5.3.
Now type out ```nvm use 5.3``` to use our newly downloaded version.

Type ```node -v``` into the terminal to verify installation of the correct version of Node.

You should now see ```v5.3``` in your terminal.

Happy coding!
